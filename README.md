Koji python stubs
=================

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the koji package. It can be used by
type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code that uses
requests. The source for this package can be found at
XXX. All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
